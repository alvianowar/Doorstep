                <h2>Indications</h2>

                <p>This is indicated for symptomatic relief of hyperacidity associated with the peptic ulcer, gastritis, peptic oesophagitis, gastric hyperacidity, heartburn, sour stomach or hiatus hernia. It is effective in the prevention of stress ulceration and GI bleeding. It acts as an antiflatulent to alleviate the symptoms of gas including post operative gas pain. This rapidly relieves acid pain, disperses gastric foam and facilitates eructation of gas and air.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "head">
                <h2>Pharmacology</h2>

                <p>This is the mixture of non-systemic acid neutralizing substances and antiflatulent. This preparation offers reliability as well as long action. Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide induce the relief of ulcer by neutralizing gastric acid secreted from parietal cells of the stomach. The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled.</p>
                <p>This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients. Following oral administration, the drug is excreted unchanged in the feces.</p>

                <h2>Interaction</h2>

                <p>All antacids may increase or decrease the rate and/or extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral drugs. Antacids decrease the bioavailability of theophyline, tetracycline, quinolone antibiotics, isoniazide, ketoconazole, ethambutol, some antimuscarinic drugs, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, ranitidine, indomethacine, nitrofurantoin, fluoride, phosphate, propanolol, atenolol, digoxins, vitamins etc. Antacids increase the bioavailability of some drugs; e.g. sulphonamides, levodopa, valproic acid, enteric coated aspirin etc.</p>
