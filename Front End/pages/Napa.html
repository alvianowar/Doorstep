                <h2>Indications</h2>

                <p>Paracetamol is indicated for fever, common cold and influenza, headache, toothache, earache, bodyache, myalgia, neuralgia, dysmenorrhoea, sprains, colic pain, back pain, post-operative pain, postpartum pain, inflammatory pain and post vaccination pain in children.

                <h2>Pharmacology</h2>

                <p>Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.</p>

                <h2>Interaction</h2>

                <p>Patients who have taken barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may show diminished ability to metabolise large doses of Paracetamol. Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Paracetamol overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Paracetamol levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.</p>
